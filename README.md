Parallel C programs
===================

Exercises from a course at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in parallel computing.

1. Introduction
-------------------
Meant as a simple introduction to C to get us started, this exercise implements some matrix related calculations in C.

2. Region growing with MPI
-------------------

3. Serial optimization
-------------------

" In this problem, you should wirte a function that performs sparse matrix vector multiplication as fast as
possible. You should do this by implementing the multiply function in the file spmv.c. Your function
should be faster than the included multiply naive. You may create your own sparse matrix format,
using the struct s matrix t."

4. Multithreading
-------------------

5. Region growing in CUDA
-------------------

6. Region growing in OpenCL
-------------------
